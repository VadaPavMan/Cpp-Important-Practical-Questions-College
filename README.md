**Note : [Algorithm 5 marks , FlowChart 5 marks, Program code : 20 marks] Total 30 Marks**

- Q1. WAP to declare a class rectangle having data members length , breadth, area. Accept and
display data for five objects.(Hint : Use array of Objects).

**Algorithm:** 

1. Start

2. Define a class **Rectangle** with the following:
  - Data members: **length, breadth, area**.
  - Member functions:
    - **inputData()** to accept length and breadth.
    - **calculateArea()** to compute the area (area = length * breadth).
    - **displayData()** to display length, breadth, and area.

3. Create an array of 5 objects of the Rectangle class.
 
4. Use a loop to:
  - Call inputData() for each object to accept length and breadth.
  - Call calculateArea() for each object to compute the area.

5. Use another loop to call displayData() for all objects to print their details.

6. End.
